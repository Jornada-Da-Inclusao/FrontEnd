## About

The Journey of Inclusion project is developed with the goal of identifying and meeting the specific needs of each child who has difficulties with inclusion in school environments.  
It utilizes a combination of interactive and personalized assessments, as well as teaching methods with resources and activities that primarily assist in literacy processes and number identification.  
The main objective is improving children individual performances, thereby promoting quality education and reducing educational inequality, aiming to achieve the fourth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).
